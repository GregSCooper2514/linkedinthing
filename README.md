# Description
Welcome! This is a simple program that automates the process of sending linked in connection requests. I recomend running the exe version, since the other version is techicly a pytest test.

# The Exe version(Non Test Version)
This is the prefered verion, it runs as an independant process, and also asks you about the inputs.

## Instalation
Clone the repository anywhere on your computer, and then run these commands inside the repository root folder.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
```
## Launching
When ready to execute run this command.
```
python exe_version.py
```
